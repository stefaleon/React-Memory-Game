## 06 Deploy to Github Pages

* Step 1: Add homepage to package.json

Open package.json and add a homepage field for the project:

```
  "homepage": "https://stefaleon.github.io/React-Memory-Game/"
```
Create React App uses the homepage field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.

* Step 2: Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json

```
$ npm install --save gh-pages
```
Add the following scripts in package.json:

```
  "scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
```
The predeploy script will run automatically before deploy is run.

* Step 3: Deploy the site by running npm run deploy

```
$ npm run deploy
```

* Step 4: Ensure your projectâ€™s settings use gh-pages

**Finally, make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the gh-pages branch**

* Step 5: Commit and Push
